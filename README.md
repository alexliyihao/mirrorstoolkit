# mirrorstoolkit

This is a summary of all the interesting utils and functions I've ever used. Mainly working on 
- image processing 
- classification 
- segmentation 
- genome analysis
- data management
- other utils

I'll frequently update this toolkit

If you want to add, use, or correct some of them, feel free to do it!
